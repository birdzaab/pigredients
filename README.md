Naming Convention Notes
-----------------------

Please note that due to some component identifiers starting with numbers eg. 74HC595, some modules are prefixed with a relevant prefix, 'ic' for integrated circuits, 'sen' for sensors, 'disp' for displays etc..  This aleviates issues with imports, and allows the use of all standard conventions when importing modules.
